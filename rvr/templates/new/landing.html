      <h3>Training that makes you think</h3>
      <p>Range vs. Range puts you in the driver's seat. This training is not about watching someone else play. Range vs. Range is watching <strong>you</strong> play. You will face exactly the kinds of decisions that you'll get at the table, and Range vs. Range will tell you exactly how to improve.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h3>Training that targets the situations you need to improve</h3>
      <p>Focus on what you want to improve. If you are a heads-up player, you can play our heads-up situation. If you want to defend the blinds more, we have a situation for that. Have trouble playing in position when you've called a 3-bet? We've got that covered too. Whatever situation it is you want to practice or improve, you can play over and over again, always getting strategic feedback on your play until you have complete confidence in that situation.</p>

      <h3>Training that makes you consider your range, not just your cards</h3>
      <p>Training on Range vs. Range is playing poker &mdash; but you don't get to see your cards. Instead, you see is your range, and you decide what hands to fold, check or call, and bet or raise with. If you know anything about playing mid-stakes and above, you already know that range-based thinking is vital to beating the regulars. Range vs. Range has it baked in from the beginning.</p>
