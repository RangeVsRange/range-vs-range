      <h3>Why are there so few questions?</h3>
<p>No one has ever heard of Range vs. Range, so no one has ever asked a
question. If you have a question, you can either email me at
<a href="mailto:rangevsrange@gmail.com">rangevsrange@gmail.com</a>, or post to the Range vs. Range subreddit:
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rangevsrange">www.reddit.com/r/rangevsrange</a>.</p>

      <h3>How do I join a game?</h3>
<p>Once you've logged in with your Google account, you can join an open game. The
list of training situations is very small right now, but more will come soon. The
logged in page will show you open games you can join, your running games, and
your finished games.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h3>How do I play?</h3>
<p>When it is your turn, your game page will have a 'Range Editor' button. On the
<a href="http://rangevsrange.pythonanywhere.com/range-editor?can_raise=true">range editor page</a>,
you can do the rest. The rannge editor shows your current range. You just have to
decide which hands you want to fold, which hands you want to call (or check),
which hands you want to raise (or bet), and the size of your raise. To start
with, all your hands are unallocated. You just have to select some hands, move
them to one of your other ranges, and repeat until you've allocated all of your
current range. Then enter a bet size and click 'Done'.</p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h3>How do I select hands?</h3>
<p>The simplest way is to click the rank combinations you want to select. To
select multiple rank combos such as 'A5s+', hold down Ctrl and click the 'A5s'
button. There is also a bunch of suit buttons. Normally, all suit combos are
selected, which means that if you move some rank combo, all suit variations will
be moved. If you want to move only specific suit combos, click the 'None' button
above the suits, then click to select the specific suit combos you want to move.

      <h3>After I enter my ranges, will I fold, call, or raise?</h3>
</p>Although you only see your range, you have in fact been dealt two cards from
that range. When you finish entering your fold, call and raise ranges, RvR simply
looks at your cards and make precisely the action you chose for those cards.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h3>Can you explain this 'play-on' thing?</h3>
</p>Play on means that any time your dealt cards happen to be in your fold range,
RvR will re-deal your hand so that it's not. To make up for the fact that you'll
never actually fold, your opponent will get paid out their fold equity
immediately, and the rest of the hand will be worth correspondingly less. For
example, when facing a raise preflop, you could fold everything except AA, and
raise with AA. You'll lose lots of money with those folds, but you will play out
the rest of the hand with a range of just AA. But your results for the hand will
barely include the results of your play with AA, because that is so little of
your original range.</p>
