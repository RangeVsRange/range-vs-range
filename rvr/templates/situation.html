<p><span id="note1"><strong>Note 1:</strong></span> Here, profitable means that you have the most room to improve your winrate. While flopping middle set in position on a dry board against an aggressive opponent might be a very profitable situation to be in, it's not a spot where post-flop training is going to make much difference to your winrate!</p>
