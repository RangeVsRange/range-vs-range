<p><em>This is one of three views of the Game Page.</em></p>
<p><em>This view is shown when it's a different player's turn. In the mean time, the user can see the hand history so far, and their current range.</em></p>
<p><em>When it becomes the user's turn again, this page will become the <a href="/game/acting">Game Page - Acting</a>.</em></p>
